do not miss to write about
- zero bayesian replacement
- Rcpp and RcppEigen (impossible not to cite Dirk)
- Rvalgrind

- TO DO:
------------------
- Flag ??
- rename files?
- reorder the git repository, remove old branches, and (suggested) use
the 'master' branch for the final work (if done, update the github link in the report )
- check the #include?
- link again ggplot (other stuff changed to test on the department resources?)
