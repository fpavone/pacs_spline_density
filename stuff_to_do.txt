- WE HAVE TO TEST THESE COMMANDS TO BE SURE THEY ALL WORK!!!
- DO WE HAVE TO PUT A SECTION "INSTALLING R PACKAGES" TO DEAL WITH DEVTOOLS?

------------------
- TO DO:
------------------
- Flag ??
- rename files?
- reorder the git repository, remove old branches, and (suggested) use
the 'master' branch for the final work (if done, update the github link in the report )
- check the #include?
- link again ggplot (other stuff changed to test on the department resources?)
