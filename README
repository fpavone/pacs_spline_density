Smoothing spline density
================================================================================

The output is an R Package [splineDensity]

The source code is written in C++ and linked to R throught the API RcppEigen and .Call

Subfolder structure
—------------------------
- src contains all C++ code and a special file named Makevars necessary to build and install the R package
- R contains the R functions that wrap the C++ calls
- data contains all .rda and .RData files useful for testings
- tests contains basic R script to run tests

To install the package, please make sure that you have the package [devtools](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/devtools/index.html) already installed.

If your compiler supports openMP parallelization modify the Makevars with a non-empty value for the OPENMP macro (default disabled).

From the root folder then type

    R -e "library(devtools); install()" —silent
    R -e "library(devtools); document()" —silent

or in another way download source code from the github repository, unzip the file and run from the terminal:

    R CMD INSTALL <path name of the package to be installed> -l <path name of the R library tree>

    (R CMD INSTALL /splineDensity -l /home/vagrant/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/3.2)
						.libPaths()

Otherwise you can install directly from github:

    devtools::install_github("fpavone/pacs_spline_density", ref = "splineDensity")

Be careful that this will not allow you to compile with enabled parallelization.
