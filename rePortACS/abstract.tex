Density estimation is a fundamental problem in explorative data analysis.
Due to the specific properties of density functions, it is not possible to tackle this kind of problem in the usual $\text{L}^2$ metric, instead Bayes spaces take into account all the geometric features of density functions. Hence raw data has to be transformed in order to be able to work in $\text{L}^2$ using a proper mapping.\\
In our project we implement the solution proposed in \citep{paper:pacs}:  optimal smoothing splines for  centred logratio transformed density functions. In this way it is possible to satisfy our ultimate goal: preprocessing of raw (discretized) distributional observations.
