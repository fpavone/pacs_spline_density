Density estimation is a fundamental problem in explorative data analysis.
Due to the specific properties of density functions, it is not possible to tackle this kind of problem in the usual $\textit{L}^2$ metric, instead Bayes spaces has to be considered to take into account all the geometric features of density functions. Hence raw data has to be transformed, using a proper mapping, in order to be able to work in $\textit{L}^2$.\\
Our project focuses on the implementation of the solution proposed in \citep{paper:pacs}: optimal smoothing splines for centred logratio transformed density functions. In this way it is possible to satisfy our ultimate goal: preprocessing of discretized distributional observations.
